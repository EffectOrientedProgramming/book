# Chaining?
We have 2 functions: f g
To compose them, the output of 1 has to be exactly the input of the other.

    z: fI => hO = f andThen g andThen h
        h(g(f))

g must take the output of f

If we want to chain f to g, and g 
Monads allow us to relate unrelated functions and treat them as a single unit.
