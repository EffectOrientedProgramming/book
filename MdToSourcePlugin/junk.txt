Or, "The one that slaughters thousands of braces"

Seriously, check out the net LoC from this PR.

Alright, I've been iterating on this throughout the day, and I'm reasonably happy with where it ended up.
I cover some of the basic differences between the original Kotlin examples, and what we want for the Scala versions.
The big one was eliminating braces in several situations. There are still cases where I couldn't eliminate every
opening brace easily, so some examples will be unbalanced until they're hand-corrected.
However, *most* of them were successfully converted.

I also added the necessary `=` in between function signatures and implementations, and converted "interface" to "trait".

I decided that I wouldn't try to remove any ``{{incomplete}}`` tags in this PR, even though there are many examples
that should be valid Scala now. We can remove those tags later.

To see the logic that drove these transformations, ctrl+f down to MdToSourcePlugin.scala, it's waaaaay at the
bottom of this PR. Or check out the branch and view it there.

Thanks for enabling tests here James, this wouldn't have been feasible otherwise.

Known issues:

There are several Kotlin-only situations, that can't be programmatically converted to Scala. At least, not without
 significant pain and insignificant pay-off.


One recurring issue is that Kotlin uses ':' to indicate inheritance, which results in this faulty transformation.

    class SpaceShipControls : Controls {
    // transforms into
    class SpaceShipControls : Controls:
    // but should be
    class SpaceShipControls extends Controls:

A case like this could be programmatically handled without too much difficulty, but when multiple
superclasses/traits are involved across multiple lines, it gets tricky enough that I think we're better off doing
 it by hand.

Companion objects don't play nicely either. There's not a good way to convert them to Scala objects, which are in
 a separate scope, rather than within the original class. I just leave them alone.

`init` and `capture` blocks don't have a simple scala translation.
