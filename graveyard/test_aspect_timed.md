### Time
#### Measuring Time
Since there is already a `.timed` method available directly on `ZIO` instances, it might seem redundant to have a `timed` `TestAspect`.
However, they are distinct enough to justify their existence.
`ZIO`s `.timed` methods changes the result type of your code by adding the duration to a tuple in the result.
This is useful, but requires the calling code to handle this new result type.
`TestAspect.timed` is a non-invasive way to measure the duration of a test.
The timing information will be managed behind the scenes, and printed in the test output, without changing any other behavior.
