A new paradigm called "Effect Oriented Programming" has emerged for building more reliable, adaptable, and testable systems. 
By separating "side effects'' from the "pure" parts of a program you gain some super-powers for handling errors, applying timeouts & retries, and testing unreliable parts in isolation. 
This book introduces the concepts of Effect Oriented Programming using simplified code examples and clear explanatory prose.
