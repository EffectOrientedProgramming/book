# Appendix ZIO

This book has deliberately tried to introduce Effects in a way that is distinct from the ZIO reference docs.
However, this does not mean that we discourage users from heavily utilizing them.

TODO: Would it make sense to introduce a chart here of common operations and which Effect types they can be applied to? (e.g. timeout can be applied to anything, retry can only be applied to X).

```scala 3
// TODO: what else? zio data type? bill doesn't like it?
```
