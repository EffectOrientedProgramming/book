# Building Reliable Systems: Functional Software Construction with Scala 3 and ZIO2

Thesis Statement:

* Support for programming has increased exponentially since computers were invented.
* We have made numerous semi-successful experiments in improving how we organize code and model systems in code.
* Bringing up the rear: *Reliability*. Efforts to consistently create reliable systems seem to be the last thing we work on.

### Individual Study

### Teaching Situations

## Getting Started

* Pointer to book's Examples repository. README for that walks through all the
  details of setup and tools. Start by copying from AtomicKotlinExamples (I've
  asked Wyett to look into this). This way we can make modifications as we
  discover what people do and don't understand, without having to update the
  book. If tools change, etc., then it's decoupled.
