# Executing External Programs
Most of this book focuses on executing Scala code all confined within a single JVM. 
However, there are times when you need to execute external programs. 
As a rule, we must treat these programs as side-effecting, because there is no practical way of ensuring they are pure.
We will explore this using `zio-process`
This chapter will cover how to do that.

## Basic shell tools
### Say
We could start with things like `echo` or `ls`, but those are easily done within Scala itself, so they are not very interesting.
