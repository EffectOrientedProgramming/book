# Preface

## Who is the book is for

This book uses Scala 3 but the focus is not on the language.
The code examples should be relatable to programmers who are familiar with:
  - Chaining operations on objects (`"asdf ".trim.length`)
  - Strong static typing
  - Functions that take parameters, can be named, and referenced
  - TODO

This book also uses Scala ZIO, an effect-oriented library for Scala, but it does not go into depth on ZIO.  To learn ZIO, see: TODO


## Code examples

The code in this book uses language syntax that might be unfamiliar.

* significant indentation
* colon syntax
