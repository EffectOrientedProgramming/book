# Preface

## Goals
Emphasize composability as a prime value for building reliable systems
Demonstrate that Effects let us reach new levels of composability.
Accomplish these goals without using fundamental/infamous concepts

  - `flatmap`
  - `monads`
  - `map`
  - `for` comprehensions

## Who is the book is for

This book uses Scala 3 but the focus is not on the language.
The code examples should be relatable to programmers who are familiar with:
  - Chaining operations on objects (`"asdf ".trim.length`)
  - Strong static typing
  - Functions that take parameters, can be named, and referenced
  - TODO

This book also uses Scala ZIO, an effect-oriented library for Scala, but it does not go into depth on ZIO.  
To learn ZIO, visit zio.dev 


## Code examples

The code examples are available at: TODO

The code in this book uses language syntax that might be unfamiliar.

* significant indentation
* colon syntax
