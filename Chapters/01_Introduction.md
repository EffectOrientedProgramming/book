# Introduction
> Building Reliable Systems: Functional Software Construction with Scala 3 and ZIO2

Thesis Statement:

* Support for programming has increased exponentially since computers were
  invented.
* We have made numerous semi-successful experiments in improving how we organize
  code and model systems in code.
* Bringing up the rear: *Reliability*. Efforts to consistently create reliable
  systems seem to be the last thing we work on.
* We want to leverage the compiler and type system to bring reliability to
  the fore

## Who this book is for

* Your background
* What to expect

This is not a comprehensive Scala 3 book. For that we recommend [Programming in
Scala 3](https://www.TODO.com). We will, however, introduce the subset of the Scala 3 language
features that we use in the book. (Also, we might describe why we're using
Scala 3. But that might not be necessary).

## How to use this book

Each section answers a fundamental question through a sequence of
lessons/chapters/lectures, each with a set of exercises.

* Designed Around a Workshop

* Short lectures Interspersed with Exercises

### Individual Study

### Teaching Situations

## Getting Started

* Pointer to book's Examples repository. README that walks through all the
  details of setup and tools. Start by copying from AtomicKotlinExamples (I've
  asked Wyett to look into this). This way we can make modifications as we
  discover what people do and don't understand, without having to update the
  book. If tools change, etc., then it's decoupled.
