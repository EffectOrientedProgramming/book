# Data Modeling


Data Modeling is the act of fitting, or matching a defined pattern or system to a set of data. It is a very broad topic 
that spans simple lines following `y = mx + b`, to complex network-style graphs. The reason for modeling can also vary
greatly from categorizing purposes, to creating systems to predict future data. However, despite the broadness of 
the topic, at its core, modeling is abstraction. From a very specific set of data, a model represents an
abstracted pattern that attempts to capture some information that the data holds.

Data, often taken from observing reality, may not be easy to interpret. Data may just be a sequence of numbers.
Modeling can give those numbers' context, and thus meaning. By matching a data model to observed reality, 
analysts can gain insight about real systems by studying the corresponding model.
