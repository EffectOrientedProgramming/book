# Monads

> A function can take any number of inputs, but it can only return a single result.

We often need to convey more information than can fit into a simple result.
The programmer is forced to use side effects to express all the outcomes of a function call.
Side effects produce unpredictable results and an unpredictable program is unreliable.

The problem is that a single simple result is *too* simple.
What we need is a complex result capable of holding all necessary information that comes out of a function call.

To solve the problem we put all that extra result information, along with the original result, into a box.
We return that box from the function.

Now we've got boxes everywhere, and programming becomes quite messy and complicated.
Every time you call a function, you must unpack and analyze the contents of the box that comes out as the result.
People probably won't use our system unless we figure out a way to automate box manipulation.

We'll use a standard set of operations that work on all boxes, to automate the use of our system and eliminate all that duplicated code.
The box---and its associated operations---is a monad.

## The Error Monad

To introduce monads, we will start with the problem of handling errors.
This is the most compelling initial use for monads.

Encountering an error during a function call generally means two things:

1. You can't continue executing the function in the normal fashion.
2. You can't return a normal result.

Many languages use *exceptions* for handling errors.
An exception *throws* out of the current execution path to locate a user-written *handler* to deal with the error.
There are two goals for exceptions:

1. Separate error-handling code from "success-path" code, so the success-path code is easier to understand and reason about.

2. Reduce redundant error-handling code by handling errors in a single place.

The problem with exceptions is that they lose important context information when they are thrown.
Also it separates "normal failure" from "exceptional failure" (Map get() example)

- Exercise: show that GenericResult.scala works with ShowResult.scala
- Exercise: Modify Above solution to work with `Int` instead of `String`
- Exercise: Show that `Either` works with ShowResult.scala
- Exercise: modify ShowResult.scala to work with `Option`
- Exercise: Modify GenericResult.scala to create GenericOption.scala, implementing your on version of `Option`
