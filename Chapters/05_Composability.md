# Composability

## Composability Explanation

## Alternatives and their downsides

Other framings/techniques and their pros/cons:

### Plain functions that throw Exceptions

- We can't union these error possibilities and track them in the type system



### Plain functions that block

- We can't indicate if they block or not
- Too many concurrent blocking operations can prevent progress of other operations
- Very difficult to manage
- Blocking performance varies wildly between environments

### Functions that return Either/Option/Try/etc

- We can manage the errors in the type system, but we can't interrupt the code that is producing these values
- All of these types must be manually transformed into the other types

### Functions that return a Future

- Can be interrupted example1[^^future_interrupted_1] two[^^future_interrupted_2]
- Manual management of cancellation
- Start executing immediately
- Must all fail with Exception
- 
### Implicits
  - Are not automatically managed by the compiler, you must explicitly add each one to your parent function
  - Resolving the origin of a provided implicit can be challenging
- Try-with-resources
  - These are statically scoped
  - Unclear who is responsible for acquisition & cleanup

Each of these approaches gives you benefits, but you can't assemble them all together.
Instead of the best of all worlds, you get the pain of all worlds.
eg `Closeable[Future[Either[Throwable, A]]]`
The ordering of the nesting is significant, and not easily changed.

The number of combinations is something like:

## Universal Composability with ZIO

ZIOs compose including errors, async, blocking, resource managed, cancellation, eitherness, environmental requirements.

The types expand through generic parameters. ie composing a ZIO with an error of `String` with a ZIO with an error of `Int` results in a ZIO with an error of `String | Int`.

With functions there is one way to compose.
`f(g(h))` will sequentially apply the functions from the inside out.  
Another term for this form of composition is called `andThen` in Scala.

With ZIO you can use `zio-direct` to compose ZIOs sequentially with:
```scala mdoc
// TODO Terrible example. Replace.
defer:
  val asdf =
    ZIO
      .succeed:
        "asdf"
      .run
  ZIO
    .succeed:
      asdf.toUpperCase
    .run
```

There are many other ways you can compose ZIOs.
The methods for composability depend on the desired behavior.
For example, to compose a ZIO that can produce an error with a ZIO that logs the error and then produces a default value, you can use the `catchAll` like:

```scala mdoc
runDemo:
  ZIO
    .attempt(???)
    .catchAll: e =>
      defer:
        ZIO
          .logError:
            e.getMessage
          .run
        ZIO
          .succeed:
            "default value"
          .run
```
