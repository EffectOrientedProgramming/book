#Functional Programming 
Functional Programming (FP) is a style of programming that focuses on the 
utilization and capabilities of pure functions. A Pure Function is a 
type of function that has three main characteristics:

1) It is a Total Function: The function will return an output for 
every possible input.
2) The output is Deterministic: Given the same inputs, the function
 will always produce the same outputs.
3) The function is Inculpable: There are no direct interactions between 
the function, and the world around it save for the inputs. This is also 
called being 'stateless', or non-dependent on the state of external factors.


##Why Functional Programming?
Functional Programming can seem like it has lots of restraints when it comes
to programming. For example, the lack of ability to use iterating or mutable variables may 
challenge the coding habits of those coming from other languages. However, there are several key
benefits when using Functional Programming:


1) Efficient and safe Parallel Programming is a major strength of FP. Because the program
state won't change, multiple processes can be running at the same time without fear of 
state-change issues. 

2) Inherently, statelessness means there are no external factors to provide unforeseen 
bugs or errors.

3) Nested Functions become much more clear, and the flow of information between 
functions is easier to follow.
   
4)FP supports lazy evaluation such as Lazy Lists and Lazy Maps.
