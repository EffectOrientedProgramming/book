<!-- ### Windows

Run the following commands (**Note:** Use cmd.exe, not Powershell):

```
> bitsadmin /transfer cs-cli https://git.io/coursier-cli-windows-exe "%cd%\cs.exe"
> .\cs --help
```

### Macintosh

Run the following commands:

```
> curl -fLo cs https://git.io/coursier-cli-"$(uname | tr LD ld)"
> chmod +x cs
> ./cs install cs
```

### Linux

Use `curl` to install **Coursier**:

```
> curl -fLo cs https://git.io/coursier-cli-"$(uname | tr LD ld)"
> cs
```
Running the `cs` command verifies that Coursier was installed. 
Now open a fresh terminal before proceeding.

If the terminal displays a message saying 'cs is not found',
check the previous command. Otherwise, enter these
commands to give execute permission to Coursier and install the
package:

```
> chmod +x cs
> ./cs install cs
> eval "$(cs install --env)"
```

If the terminal displays a message like:

```
Warning: /home/ExamplePath/Example/coursier/bin is not in your PATH
```

Use the following command, replacing the `<Insert Path>` with the path from the
above warning message:

```
> export PATH="$PATH:/<Insert Path>/coursier/bin"
```

For example, if the warning message is:

```
Warning: /home/bob/.local/share/coursier/bin is not in your PATH
```

Run this:

```
> export PATH="$PATH:/home/bob/.local/share/coursier/bin"
```

You'll want to put a line like this in your `~/.bashrc`, as well.

Then enter these commands to give execute permission to Coursier and install the
package:

```
> chmod +x cs
> ./cs install cs
> eval "$(cs install --env)"
``` -->
