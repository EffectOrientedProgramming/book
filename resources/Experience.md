I don't have a strong investment or impetus to finish this book if the project
doesn't work out, so I think it would be easy to walk away from it if it fails.
For that reason, I don't want to put up an early-access edition before it's
clear that the book is far enough along; if we sold that and then the project
didn't work out, I'd feel obligated to finish it.

project? Do you want to be more represented in the Scala community, or help
with your position at your company? Are you hoping to make a contribution to
the community? Do you want to use the book as a foundation for teaching? What
doors do you imagine opening when the book is out? What else do you imagine
about doing this book? How will this project make your life better?

## Your Needs

* (*Questions like these...*)

* What kinds of accommodations do you need to be satisfied and productive on this project?

* What kind of time do you want to give to it?

* How do you envision the financial structure of this project?

* When do you imagine it will be done?

*Nothing wrong with having a strategic objective. Also nothing wrong with
thinking about how to get there, and even planning the first few steps. But if
that plan can't change dynamically based on inspection and feedback as you
move forward, there's no agility.*&mdash;[Allen Holub](https://twitter.com/allenholub)
