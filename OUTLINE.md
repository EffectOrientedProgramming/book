## Outline

Notes:
- First 5 chapters are about the why - bring the wow.
- Chapters 6 on are about the how.

1. Superpowers with Effects
    1. OpeningHook (1-6)
        1. Note: Progressive enhancement through adding capabilities 
    1. Concurrency
        1. Race
        1. Hedge (to show the relationship to OpeningHook ie progressive enhancement)
    1. Sequential
        1. Note: Combine OpeningHook & Concurrency with ZIO Direct
    1. And so much more
        1. Note: And there are many capabilities you might want to express. In the future we will dive into these other capabilities.
1. Functions & Specialized Data Types Are Great
    1. Why Functional
1. But Functions & Specialized Data Types Don't Compose for Effects
    1. Composability
        1. Limitations of Functions & SDTs
        1. Some intro to Universal Effect Data Types ie ZIO
        1. The ways in which ZIOs compose (contrasted to limitations)
        1. Note: Merge chapters: composability, Unit, The_ZIO_Type
        1. Note: Avoid explicit anonymous sum & product types at this point
1. Dependency Injection with Effects
    1. App vs Test
    1. Composability
1. Concurrency & Async (We maybe need other words here)
    1. Safe, performant, efficient, reliable
1. ...
